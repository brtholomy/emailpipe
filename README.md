This is my emailpipe. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

How to send to production:

```sh
./emailpipe --slug glossolalia --prod
```

To read from local RSS rather than the default bartholomy.ooo live URL:

```sh
./emailpipe --slug glossolalia --source "/home/bth/y/dev/bartholomy.ooo/public/posts/index.xml"
```
